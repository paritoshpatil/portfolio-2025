            review: `Kafka on the Shore was my first Murakami novel, and it completely changed the way I thought about storytelling. I’d always heard about the surreal, pseudo-fantasy worlds he created, but I hesitated to dive in, worried the English translations might flatten his ideas. I’m glad I finally gave it a chance—this quickly became one of my deserted-island books.

The story alternates between Kafka, a teenage boy who runs away from home to escape an Oedipus prophecy, and Nakata, an elderly man who can talk to cats. Each chapter switches perspective, slowly stacking up like Jenga blocks until the surreal picture begins to make sense—though, as with most Murakami novels, the ending resists easy explanation and is left to the reader’s interpretation.

What struck me was the balance: absurdity, humor, tension, and fantasy all woven together in a dreamlike setting. The characters are unforgettable, the atmosphere lingers, and the musical references are a bonus. Murakami doesn’t hand you answers—he makes you live with the questions. Kafka may be on the shore, but this book pulled me deep into his world and left me wanting more.

            review: `I first read The White Tiger in middle school after borrowing it from my friend Ajinkya. The cover caught my attention, but the description sealed it: “Meet Balram Halwai, the White Tiger: Servant, Philosopher, Entrepreneur, Murderer …” Up until then, my reading life was Enid Blyton, Goosebumps, and school textbooks. This novel felt dangerous, raw, and exciting in ways I hadn’t encountered before.

Balram is born into poverty in a small Indian village, where powerful men control everything. He manages to find work as a driver for a wealthy family’s youngest son and moves to Delhi. Through his eyes, we see India in all its contradictions: opportunity and corruption, ambition and despair. When his master kills a homeless girl in a drunken accident, Balram is coerced into taking the blame, believing it his duty. That acceptance becomes the catalyst for his awakening, pushing him toward freedom and, eventually, a shocking climax.

Adiga’s prose is sharp and cinematic. The way he paints India—the grime, chaos, absurdity, and hunger for escape—felt so vivid it was no surprise when the book was adapted into a film. This novel left a permanent mark on me. I even bought a copy after losing Ajinkya’s—sorry, bro.

            review: `After Kafka on the Shore, I became fascinated with Murakami’s work. I soon discovered that while Kafka is often considered his masterpiece, it was Norwegian Wood that made him famous. Naturally, it became the next book I picked up, and though I expected another surreal fantasy, I was pleasantly surprised by how grounded it was.

Named after the Beatles’ song, the novel follows Watanabe, a young college student in Tokyo navigating love, grief, and the confusion of early adulthood. After his best friend’s suicide, he reconnects with Naoko, the girl Kizuki left behind. Their fragile relationship, however, unravels when Naoko disappears into her own struggles. Meanwhile, Watanabe drifts between college life, a job at a record store, nights out with friends, and a growing bond with Midori, whose presence offers a striking contrast.

Though less fantastical than Murakami’s other works, the characters feel intensely real. What stood out most to me was how vividly Murakami captured 1980s Tokyo—the atmosphere, the mood, the music. The novel’s ending is deliberately open, forcing readers to step into Watanabe’s shoes and imagine their own closure. It may not be for everyone, but for me, it was one of the most moving introductions to Murakami’s Japan.

            review: `I’d been raving about Murakami for months before my girlfriend surprised me with three more of his novels. She kept Sputnik Sweetheart and handed me After Dark. Like most Murakami works, I’d recommend going in blind—but here’s a glimpse.

Set in 2000s Tokyo, the story unfolds over the course of a single night, with each chapter marked by a timestamp. It alternates between sisters Mari and Eri Asai. Mari, sitting in a Denny’s trying to read, is pulled into an incident at Alphaville, a seedy “love hotel” run by Kaoru. Meanwhile, Eri lies in an unnerving sleep, observed by what feels like an invisible camera. Their stories intersect through Shirakawa, a businessman whose violent act earlier in the evening drags Mari into Alphaville’s underworld.

The novel is steeped in unease and surrealism. What stood out most to me was the world-building—it feels like you’re floating above Tokyo, zooming into lives as a detached spectator. By the end, I realized I cared less about the characters and more about that feeling of voyeurism, which seems intentional.

This isn’t a book for everyone, but for me, it was unforgettable. Murakami made me feel like a camera—and left me wanting to move to Tokyo.

            review: `I have a special relationship with this book. Growing up, I never had an allowance, which meant I couldn’t just buy things without asking my parents. One day, while wandering Crossword with my sister, I spotted this novel. I ran home, begged my mother for 300 rupees, and rushed back to buy it — my very first novel.

As the title suggests, it tells the story of a Japanese man who survives the Hiroshima bombing, only to endure the Nagasaki blast days later. The premise alone is staggering, but what makes it unforgettable is the narrator: indifferent, arrogant, and deeply unlikeable. Through his detached perspective, we witness the grotesque aftermath of war, all while asking—why did he survive when so many perished? Yet, as his journey unfolds, cracks in his selfishness appear, and moments of selflessness take root.

Atmosphere is what I treasure most in books, and this one delivers in haunting detail. The prose is simple, but vivid enough to immerse you in its world of devastation. I first read it in 2013, and I return to it every few years, letting the horror and humanity strike me anew.

            review: `I started making music in 2014, writing songs in 2016, and reading poetry in 2017. But I discovered Gulzar criminally late. I had always admired his vast contribution to Bollywood from a distance, but it wasn’t until I stumbled upon this book through a Twitter recommendation that I finally dove in. Gulzar often jokes that he holds a “copyright” on the moon, given how often it appears in his work — and this book shows why.

At first, I assumed it would be a collection of poems about the moon. Instead, it is a thoughtful study of how Gulzar takes a single object or idea and spins it into infinite expressions. Author Saba Mahmood Bashir gathers examples from songs, poems, stories, even ads, and weaves them together with sharp analysis and insight. It fundamentally changed the way I thought about songwriting, while also introducing me to music I might never have discovered.

The highlight for me was finding the song Mera Kuchh Saamaan from Ijaazat. Its metaphors of love and loss shook me, and I couldn’t stop sharing it with friends. Now, it’s one of our favorites — a song for quiet nights, reflection, and awe.`

            review: `I owe a lot to this book. I first stole it from my school library in protest of the absurd “one library day a month” rule. For years it sat unread, until a trip to Surat with my cousins — where, with little else to do, I finally opened it. That trip also gave me the lifelong habit of carrying a book everywhere.

The catch? It was the fifth book in the Percy Jackson series, and I hadn’t read the first four. Still, the world instantly hooked me: Greek gods fathering half-blood children, Camp Half-Blood where they train, and Percy — Poseidon’s son — caught in a war to protect Mt. Olympus from the Titan Lord Kronos. The writing was fast, atmospheric, and thrilling, even if I was a little lost.

But this book’s real impact on me had nothing to do with plot. Around the same time, I was discovering music production with my friend Mohit and searching for a name. In chapter 19, Percy says, “My limbs felt like lead.” That line clicked. I’d felt that heaviness before — right before moments that could change my life. That day on the bus home, I chose to call myself LeadHeart, and I've never looked back.`

            review: `Men Without Women is a collection of short stories by Haruki Murakami that all circle around the idea of strange, often fragile relationships. A friend recommended it to me, particularly the opening story Drive My Car. It follows an aging actor who, after losing his license, hires a young female driver. During their rides, he reflects on his late wife and her infidelities. It’s the strongest of the bunch — grounded in reality yet still carrying Murakami’s signature strangeness, with a relationship that feels like it could bloom at any moment.

A few others stood out — Scheherazade, where a confined man is visited by a woman with surreal, intimate tales, and Kino, about a bar owner whose life unravels after his cat disappears and snakes appear. Yet the magic of Murakami, for me, lies in his long-form: lush world-building, characters who breathe, and the seamless stitching of reality with fantasy. Short stories don’t leave enough space for that. These tales end just before they become fully engrossing, leaving you with a haunting aftertaste but not the satisfaction of a full novel.

So I’m divided. As casual, bite-sized reads, they work. As an introduction to Murakami, though, I’d point people elsewhere — or better yet, to the Drive My Car film adaptation.`

            review: `I first read Mice in Men by Anirban Bose thanks to a happy accident — my sister gifted it to me, mistaking it for Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men. I still haven’t read Steinbeck, but I’m not disappointed by the mix-up. Bose’s book is a collection of short stories set in India, and unlike Murakami’s Men Without Women, here’s a writer who thrives within the short story format. Each piece is bite-sized yet complete, with satisfying conclusions that make the form work beautifully.

There’s no central theme, though doctors and medical settings appear often — unsurprising given Bose is a doctor himself. The standouts for me include The New Job, where a poor man drives his wealthy employer to daily trysts while wrestling with his conscience; Mice in Men, where saving a rat from extermination changes a civil servant’s life; and The Balloonwala, about how a doctor’s small kindness comes back to him in unexpected ways.

Bose’s stories are cleanly written, with a clear premise, setup, and often a twist that feels earned. This isn’t the kind of book that demands deep reflection — and that’s the point. It’s perfect for waiting rooms, bus rides, or quiet afternoons. In fact, my copy lives in my scooter trunk as my backup book.`
