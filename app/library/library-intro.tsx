            Like many kids, I loved reading in school but drifted away from it during high school and college.
            Around the same time, I developed persistent insomnia that lingered for years. Working in tech only made
            it worseâ€”I spent all day in front of a screen, then carried the habit into late nights. To break the cycle,
            I began reading again before bed. While sleep is still a struggle, this helped me reset my routine and
            build a steady habit of finishing at least one book a month.
